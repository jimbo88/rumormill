Instructions for running the simulator:

The 
usage: 
java RumorMill inputfile graphmode numberofsimulations

graph modes are integers and include:

0: told or not
1: number of times told
2: firstheard
3: no graph output

Each simulator invocation must be provided with an input file in order
to set modes for the simulator and to set up the initial board state.

input files must be provided in the following format. The first three lines 
set board parameters and modes and the remaining lines are comma separated 
coordinates that refer to cells that initially know the rumor
----
boardDimension (dimension of the square array as an integer)
EIGHTMODE|FOURMODE (which update rule to follow?)
true|false (is wrap-around on?)
xcoord,ycoord
xcoord2,ycoord2
etc,etc
----
Please see the input1 file for an example of the format

Example invocation:

java RumorMill input1 0 1000

this will run the simulation specified in the input1 file 
using graphmode=0, 1000 times.
